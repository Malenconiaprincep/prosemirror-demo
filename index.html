  <h2>Demonstration Text</h2>

  <p>On the block level you can have:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Ordered lists (such as this one)</li>
    <li>Bullet lists</li>
    <li>Blockquotes</li>
    <li>Code blocks</li>
    <li>Tables</li>
    <li>Horizontal rules</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It isn't hard to define your own custom elements, and include them in your
    schema. These can be opaque 'leaf' nodes, that the user manipulates through
    extra interfaces you provide, or nodes with regular editable child nodes.
  </p>

  <h2>The Model</h2>

  <p>
    Nodes can nest arbitrarily deep. Thus, the document forms a tree, not
    dissimilar to the browser's DOM tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the inline level, the model works differently. Each block of text is a
    single node containing a flat series of inline elements. These are
    serialized as a tree structure when outputting HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    Positions in the document are represented as a path (an array of offsets)
    through the block tree, and then an offset into the inline content of the
    block. Blocks that have no inline content (such as horizontal rules and HTML
    blocks) can not have the cursor inside of them. User-exposed operations on
    the document preserve the invariant that there is always at least a single
    valid cursor position.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>We did not see a nested blockquote yet.</p></blockquote>

  <pre><code class="lang-markdown">Nor did we see a code block

Note that the content of a code block can't be styled.</code></pre>

  <p>This paragraph has<br />a hard break inside of it.</p>
